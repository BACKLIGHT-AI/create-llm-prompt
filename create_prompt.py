"""
This script scans your project directory and creates a Markdown file (output.txt)
that contains both:
  1. A tree representation of your project's directory structure.
  2. The contents of code files (filtered by file type).

This is especially useful for providing context (to an AI or a human reviewer)
about your project's layout and source code.

Usage:
  - Place this script in your project's root directory.
  - Run it with: python create_prompt.py
  - The generated file "output.txt" will include the directory tree and the code files.
  
Configuration:
  - EXCLUDED_DIRS: Directories to ignore (e.g., .git, node_modules).
  - EXCLUDED_FILES: Specific files to ignore.
  - EXCLUDED_EXTENSIONS: File types to ignore (e.g., images, binary files, JSON, etc.).
